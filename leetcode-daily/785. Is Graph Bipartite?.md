# 785. Is Graph Bipartite?

There is an undirected graph with n nodes, where each node is numbered between 0 and n - 1. You are given a 2D array graph, where graph[u] is an array of nodes that node u is adjacent to. More formally, for each v in graph[u], there is an undirected edge between node u and node v. The graph has the following properties:

There are no self-edges (graph[u] does not contain u).
There are no parallel edges (graph[u] does not contain duplicate values).
If v is in graph[u], then u is in graph[v] (the graph is undirected).
The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes u and v such that there is no path between them.
A graph is bipartite if the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets A and B such that every edge in the graph connects a node in set A and a node in set B.

Return true if and only if it is bipartite.

### Example
```
Input: graph = [[1,2,3],[0,2],[0,1,3],[0,2]]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no way to partition the nodes into two independent sets such that every edge connects a node in one and a node in the other.
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // since we are given an adjacency list , we are using BFS

    bool bfs(int sv, vector<int> & color, vector<vector<int>> graph) {
        queue<int> q;
        q.push(sv);
        color[sv] = 1;

        while(!q.empty() ) {
            int front = q.front();
            q.pop();

            for(auto it : graph[front]) {
                if(color[it] == -1) {
                    color[it] = 1 - color[front];
                    q.push(it);
                } else if(color[it] == color[front]) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }

        return true;

    }


    bool isBipartite(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
        int n = graph.size();
        vector<int> color(n,-1);

        for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {
            if(color[i] == -1) {
                if(bfs(i,color,graph) == false) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
};
